### Steps/Flags
    # TODO

### Remediation
    Restrict access to only those IP addresses that require it. To restrict access to a specific IP address, set the suffix to /32 (for example, 192.0.2.10/32). Be sure to delete overly permissive rules after creating rules that are more restrictive.

    Review and delete unused security groups. You can use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally configure and manage security groups at scale across AWS accounts, For more information, see the AWS Firewall Manager documentation.

    Consider using Systems Manager Sessions Manager for SSH (Port 22) and RDP (Port 3389) access to EC2 instances. With sessions manager, you can access your EC2 instances without enabling port 22 and 3389 in the security group
